# q9
# A string is said to be palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For e.g.
# “Kayak” is a palindrome because if we try to read it from backward, it is same as
# forward. One approach to check if a string is palindrome is to iterate through the
# string till middle of string and compare a character from back and forth.
# Use recursion to develop a python function (or functions) that checks if a string is
# palindrome. The main function should accept a string and returns true/false. You
# may assume all strings have lower-case letters.
# Example Input: kayak Output: true
# Example Input: hello Output: false
